# theta
A minimal oh-my-zsh prompt.

## About
This is the theme I personally use in oh-my-zsh. It is designed to be as minimal as possible and does
not contain any static or dynamic info. If you like minimalism then this theme might be for you, though
I would recomend building your own. Theta because of the initial letter in my name.

## Requirements
To work correctly, you will first need:

- `zsh` to be your shell
- `oh-my-zsh` to be installed
- Support for `utf-8` characters

## Installing

Now that the requirements are satisfied, you can install theta by using:

```
git clone https://github.com/2019342a/theta.git "$ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/theta"
```

Set ZSH_THEME="theta" in your .zshrc.
